# `#git-scraping` my spotify data

Turns out i can use selenium to get automate the authorization process and then ask for the recently played songs, yay!

Just need to automate the getting geckodriver etc 

## TODO
* Figure out gecko driver automation (probably just adding it to the repo or using those libraries that automatically get it)
* Move from notebooks to scripts
* Data validation because _data engineering_
* Read more on git scraping and make sure this is actually what im doing
* Come up with a schema ? I don't want just the track title, artist and when i heard it
* bonus: heroku datasette site reading this :eyes:
